# What is Mean Bot?
Mean Bot is a discord bot with the goal to prevent unwanted spam in certain text channels. Whenever the bot detects someone saying one of the certain words, it will respond to that message using one of the responsive words. Everything is customizable for the bot, it just isn't very obvious. I will 100% update it's readability in the future.

# How to use
If you just want to use the bot with the presets, then you will have to replace *client.run(os.environ['TOKEN'])* with *client.run('YOUR TOKEN')* If you want are using replit then you don't need to change the code, all you have to do is a dd a secret called *token*.
